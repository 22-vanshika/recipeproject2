                      Sauté cumin seeds for potato filling To make delicious
                      samosas at home, first, make the filling. Put a pan on
                      medium flame and add 2 tsp oil in it. Once the oil is hot
                      enough, add cumin seeds and allow them to crackle.

                      Add spices and boiled potatoes and cook for a while Now,
                      add whole coriander seeds, ginger and green chilli. Saute
                      for a minute and then add chopped cashews and raisins,
                      peanuts if you like them, boiled and mashed potatoes,
                      cumin powder, coriander powder, garam masala powder, red

                      Prepare the dough for the Samosa Now, to prepare the
                      dough, take a mixing bowl and combine all-purpose flour
                      along with carom seeds and salt. Mix and then add ghee and
                      start kneading by adding a little water at a time. Ensure
                      that you add water gradually and make a firm dough. A soft
                      dough will not make your samosas crispy. Cover the dough
                      with a damp muslin cloth and keep aside for about half an
                      hour.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Roll the dough in small puris and cut into half Once done,
                      roll out few small-sized balls from the dough. Flatten
                      them further with the help of your palms and then with a
                      rolling pin. Give them a round shape and cut in half. Now
                      dip your hands in water, fold the edges of the semi-circle
                      in order to give it a cone shape.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Fill the semi-circle with potato filling and deep fry Take
                      the filling with the help of a spoon and stuff it in the
                      cone. Seal the ends properly by pressing the edges lightly
                      with your fingers. Then, heat oil in a pan and deep fry
                      the samosas on low heat until they turn golden brown and
                      crispy. Serve with tomato ketchup and green chutney. Enjoy
                      it as a tea-time snack!

                      Make the boondi batter. To make this traditional Indian

                      flour, then mix orange colour and mix it well. Then, add
                      some water and a little baking soda. Blend the mixture
                      well and make sure there are no lumps. Once the blend

                      and add some of the batter. Slowly let the boondi batter
                      fall in the oil and cook them on a low flame, till
                      properly cooked. Once done, place the boondi on a tissue

                      until it attains a two-string consistency. Then add some
                      cardamom powder and let it cook. Then add the boondis and
                      cook till the sugar syrup and boondi is perfectly mixed.

                      Knead the dough. To make this easy Pani Puri recipe at
                      home, take a bowl and add semolina, wheat flour, baking
                      soda along with a little salt and water as required and
                      prepare a stiff dough. Adding semolina will make the puris
                      crispy. Then, cover it with a muslin cloth, let it remain
                      aside for about half an hour..
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Roll out puris. After half an hour, knead the flour again
                      and roll out a few small-sized balls from the prepared
                      dough. Next, place the balls on a flat surface and with
                      the help of wheat flour, flatten and make them thin enough
                      to give them the appearance of very small, round puris.
                      You can alternately roll out a large puri and cut small
                      discs with a round cookie cutter or small bowl.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Deep fry the puris. Now, place a pan on medium flame and
                      pour refined oil. Once the oil is sufficiently hot, fry
                      the prepared round-shaped puris. Fry 3-4 at a time while
                      making sure each one puffs all right. Also, keep the flame
                      medium as excess heat might burn the puris.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Cool these fried puris. Once well-cooked, take them out
                      immediately and place them on a paper towel in order to
                      get rid of extra oil. Let them cool and keep aside. Your
                      next step would be to prepare pani for the puris.
